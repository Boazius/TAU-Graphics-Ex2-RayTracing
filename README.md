### Basic Ray Tracer
This project involves the implementation of a basic ray tracer. The ray tracer simulates the propagation of light rays from an observer's eye (the camera) through a screen and into a scene containing various surfaces. The implementation calculates the intersections of rays with surfaces, determines the nearest intersection, and computes the color of the surface based on its material and lighting conditions.

### Features
The ray tracer includes the following features:

#### Surfaces
- Spheres
- Infinite planes
- Cubes

#### Materials
Each surface is associated with a specific material that includes attributes such as:
- Diffuse color
- Specular color
- Phong specularity coefficient
- Reflection color
- Transparency

#### Lights
The scene is illuminated by point lights, each with attributes including position, color, specular intensity, shadow intensity, and light radius.

### Camera and General Settings
The camera is defined by parameters such as position, look-at point, up vector, screen distance, and screen width. General settings include the background color, number of shadow rays, and maximum recursion level.

### Implementation Details
The ray tracer is implemented in Python and accepts a scene file as input. The scene file contains the definition of all surfaces, materials, light sources, camera settings, and general render settings. The code is designed to run in the command line and supports the generation of images based on the provided scene description.

### Soft Shadows
The project incorporates soft shadows to simulate the effect of light sources with a certain area. The light intensity that hits the surface from the
light source will be multiplied by the number of rays that hit the surface divided
by the total number of rays we sent. For example, if we send 25 rays from the
light source and 5 of them hit the surface at the given point, the surface will
be 20% illuminated at that point. If the number of shadow rays parameter is 1
only one ray will be cast and the shadows will be hard.
The sent rays should simulate a light which has a certain area. Each light is
defined with a light radius

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
- clone or download the repository
- open shell in the repository folder
- verify python and pip are installed ( use ``` python --version ``` and ```pip --version```)
- install requirements using  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
- copy your desired scene txt file into the folder, preferably into the input folder

now, to run the application simply type:
``` bash
python Raytracer.py
```

with the following arguments
1. An absolute / relative path to the scene text file you want to process
2. An absolute / relative path to the image png you want to create
3. (Optional) height - the output image height, defaults to 500
4. (Optional) width - the output image width, defaults to 500

so for example
``` bash
python raytracer.py "input/pool.txt", "scenes/pool200x200.png", "200", "200"
```
will run the ray tracer on pool.txt and output the pool200x200.png file.
